# PortfolioProject1

In this project, SQL skills were applied to analyze COVID-19 data. The project involved various techniques such as Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTE's), Temporary Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types.

The analysis covered multiple aspects, including:

Initial Data Selection:

Selected data from the 'CovidDeaths' table, filtering for records where the continent information was available.
Total Cases vs Total Deaths:

Explored the likelihood of fatality after contracting COVID-19 in different countries.
Calculated the death percentage based on the total cases and total deaths.
Total Cases vs Population:

Analyzed what percentage of a country's population had been infected with COVID-19.
Calculated the percentage of the population infected based on total cases and population data.
Countries with Highest Infection Rate:

Identified countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population.
Determined the maximum infection count and the percentage of population infected in each country.
Countries with Highest Death Count per Population:

Determined countries with the highest death count relative to their population.
Calculated the total death count for each country.
This project provided insights into the impact of COVID-19 in different regions and countries, helping to assess infection and fatality rates, and highlighting areas of concern.
